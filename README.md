# cppnb

**cppnb** (C++ Notebook) is a native Jupyter-style notebook environment built with C++ using **Dear ImGui**, **TextEditor**, **ImPlot**, and **imgui_markdown** — powered by **GLFW** or **SDL2**. This project brings an interactive notebook experience, similar to Jupyter, to C++ developers in a fast and lightweight desktop application.
