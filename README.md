# cppnb

🚧 **Work in Progress — Initial Scaffolding Stage**  
A native C++ Jupyter-style notebook built with **Dear ImGui**, **TextEditor**, **ImPlot**, and **Markdown** rendering.

Designed for:
- ✍️ Note-taking in Markdown
- ⚙️ Executable C++ code cells
- 📊 Visualizing data via ImPlot
- 🤖 Learning & building AI/ML projects with libraries like `Eigen`, `xtensor`, `Shogun`, etc.

## 🧠 Why cppnb?

As a student learning AI/ML using C++, I needed a lightweight, interactive notebook — similar to Jupyter — but native to C++. This tool is being developed to streamline that workflow and give me full control over execution, plotting, and layout.
